changes: 
  - bugfix: "IPCs will now encounter a BSOD (blue-screen-of-death) when dying, before their display goes blank, and will get their screen temporarily set to the Console one upon revival, as previously intended."
  - refactor: "Refactored how IPCs were setting up their chassis and their head, allowing them to be properly set for real this time. Let your imagination go wild!"
